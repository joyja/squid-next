Ignition is a modular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition platform. It features unlimited licensing, web-based deployment, and is cross platform. It would work well as a small stand alone SCADA system on your edge hardware and we recommned using it with the PostgreSQL container to store historical data and other applications requiring persistent database storage.

Some of Ignition's features, such as the OPCUA server, run without a license, but most of them require a license to run for more than 2 hours. If you have questions about whether you need a license send an email to <info@jarautomation.io>. We can provide you a license with your purchase or you can bring your own.
