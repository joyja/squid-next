Codesys Control is a powerful softPLC for Linux that gives you access to all of the IEC61131-3 programming languages through their free Codesys Development Environment. It is incredibly flexible, with most industrial and I.I.O.T protocols built in.

Codesys Control will run for 2 hours before needing to be restarted without a license. We can provide a license for you or you can bring your own.
